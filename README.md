"# computer_vision" 

This Project is just to bush up by computer vision skills and to make a as complete as it could be for all computer vision algorithms and work.

## normal computer vision

1. add watermark
2. calculate average brighness
3. filter image by kernels
4. get image info
5. Histogram of gradients
6. color distribution graph (in all main colours with nearby how much it is) and display histogram of all.

up next:
1. ORB , SIFT , rBRIEF , FASt
2. Corner detection
3. black line detection like line horizontal, vertically
4. from grayscale distribution of lines(of blackness) horizontally and vertically.Like projection of distribution on c and y axis useful for character recogntion.
5. Histogram equalization
6. thresholding of grayscale image. (default OTSU, can give it too)
7. Animation detection
8. basic operation : flipping, rotate (like 90 degree,180,270), crop , write text in image , draw rectangle , draw polygon , paste method to one image top of other


## deep learning projects

1. MNIST dataset - custom CNN with 2 convolution , 98% accuracy

up next:
1. CIFAR-10
2. dog vs cat
3. dog breed prediction
4. Alphabet dataset , similar to MNIST (unbalanced data)
5. Facial keypoint detections / Face detection
6. FashionMNIST
